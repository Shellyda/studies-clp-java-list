I used an interface in `SmartDevice` because it defines a contract that all devices must follow without enforcing a fixed hierarchy. Unlike an abstract class, an interface allows any class to implement it freely, making it easier to add new devices without modifying the existing structure. Additionally, Java does not support multiple class inheritance but allows multiple interfaces, making the system more flexible and modular.
