The chosen implementation uses composition, where colors (`Blue`, `Green`, etc.) are separate classes that apply effects to monsters instead of creating subclasses for each variation.  

**Pros:**  
- Makes the code more modular and easier to expand, allowing new colors to be added without modifying the `Monster` class.  
- Prevents the creation of numerous subclasses like `BlueDragon` or `YellowWolf`.  
- Keeps responsibilities well-separated, making maintenance easier.  

**Cons:**  
- Requires an extra step to apply the color to the monster.  
- Color classes directly modify the monster's attributes, which may lead to unexpected effects.  
- Does not allow easy combination of multiple colors.  

Other approaches could include using inheritance (simpler but less flexible) or a Decorator (more dynamic but more complex).  
Overall, composition is a solid choice, but it could be refined to improve control over modifications.
